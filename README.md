# What I Learned

- Learned that I can select :hov state in Chrome developer tools to show the :hover styles and other states as well.

- CSS float can also be used in layouting with attributes such as left and right.
```css
float: left;
```

- The destructuring assignment of JavaScript ES6 applies to the useState of React.

- React controlled and uncontrolled component. In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.

- Using map Array method with ES6 syntax:
```JSX
{notes.map((note, index) => {
        return (<Note
          key={index}
          title={note.title}
          content={note.content}
        />)
      })}
```

- JavaScript Array methods Map and Filter

- The attribute "disabled" for button element or the Fab component of MUI can be set using conditional rendering. The button is disabled until the text is written in the text area on input fields.

- The attribute "defaultValue" for the input element renders the value.

- Using "inherit" as value in CSS to inherit the style of the parent element.

- Using width: 100% to center the element with text-align center.

- I'm proud of initializing the title and content of a note component, this is needed in case if you only edit the title or content and not causing a initialized blank text.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
